Piston in an infinite baffle example
====================================
"""

#%% The piston in an infinite baffle is a classic model used to describe
# the beamshapes of mouth-emitting bat species [1,2], among other animals [3]. 
# It's easily to compute, but however can only describe the beamshape upto :math:`\pm90^{\circ}`
# off-axis. Let's see an example of what the piston model outputs


from bat_beamshapes import piston_in_infinite_baffle_directionality
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np 

# %% 
# The piston in an infinite baffle has two parameters `k` and `a` 
# (for more on these)parameters see :doc:`here<../general_intro>`.
