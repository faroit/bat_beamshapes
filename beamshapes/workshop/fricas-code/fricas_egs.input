-- This script has examples for certain things that I'd like to do --

++ Numerical integration/quadrature 
++ Let's integrate a familiar function and get the value out. 

sin_integ := integrate(sin(x),x=0..%pi)
sin_integ

++ Now, let's integrate the same function, but this time 
++ numerically. The inbuilt numerical quadrature routines
++ require multiple values, as they split the evaluation
++ interval adaptively till the convergence criteria are
++ met (either absolute acceptable error, or relative error)

abs_error := 0.001
rel_error := 0.95
initial_intervals := 50
min_intervals := 10
max_intervals := 100

-- define the function --
some_function(x) == sin(x)

num_integ := aromberg(some_function,0,%pi,abs_error_
                        ,rel_error,min_intervals,max_intervals,initial_intervals)
num_integ
++ We can see the results of the numerical integration. The results are stored in 
++ a 'record' type object -- which is kind of like a Python dictionary. We access
++ the values to check how much
