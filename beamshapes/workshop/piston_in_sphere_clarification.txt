Hello Thejasvi,
This is correct and I have checked it against numerical calculation of the integral. It is Eq. (A2.70) on p. 843 that has the error. I have updated the errata to indicate a sign change which is achieved by replacing “m(m + 1) - n(n + 1)” with “n(n + 1) - m(m + 1)”.
All the best,
Tim
