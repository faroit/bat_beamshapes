 - Thejasvi Beleyur & Gaurav Dhariwal
Modelling bat beamshapes using various acoustic models, and trying to fit them with data. 

The beamshape models being implemented are:

1. Vibrating cap of a sphere: Aarts & Janssen 2010, Comparing sound radiation from a loudspeaker with that from a flexible spherical cap on a rigid sphere, confererence paper 2010

2. Piston in a closed finite baffle: Mellow and Kärkkäinen 2005, On the sound field of an oscillating disk in a finite open and closed circular baffle, JASA

3. Piston in an infinite baffle
